# Image-Processing-and-Manipulation-with-PIL
In this repository, I have tried to process the image of Honeybee and point its difference from Bubble bee.The question at hand is: can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? These bees have different behaviors and appearances, but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart.
